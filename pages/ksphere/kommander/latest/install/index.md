### Obtaining Konvoy with Kommander

[Sign up to be notified](https://d2iq.com/solutions/ksphere/kommander#get-notified) about Kommander availability and then see the detailed instructions found at the [Konvoy installation guide](/ksphere/konvoy/latest/install/)

### Logging in with Username and Password

After you provision your first Konvoy cluster, your username, password, and a URL to Konvoy will be printed to the command-line. Once in Konvoy, you should see a button labelled "Try Kommander Beta!". If not, check to ensure you've installed the Konvoy release that includes Kommander.
